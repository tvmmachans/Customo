Place your site logo here:

- Filename: logo.png
- Path: public/images/logo.png
- Recommended: 512x512 (square), PNG or WebP. The Navigation component also accepts `logo.svg` if you prefer vector.

How to use:
1. Save the attached image from the editor into this folder as `logo.png`.
2. Start the frontend dev server (see project README). The header will load `/images/logo.png` automatically and `index.html` includes a favicon link.

If you want me to add the exact binary image into the repo, either upload the image file to the repository or tell me to create a base64-embedded data image (note: embedding increases bundle size).
