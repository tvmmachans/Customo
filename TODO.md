# Implementation Plan for Customo Features

## 1. Backend Integration: Deploy Java Spring Boot API with PostgreSQL
- [x] Add PostgreSQL driver to pom.xml
- [x] Verify application-prod.properties for PostgreSQL config
- [x] Update docker-compose.yml if needed for PostgreSQL

## 2. Authentication Guards: Add route protection for private pages
- [x] Create JwtAuthenticationFilter class
- [x] Update SecurityConfig.java to include JWT filter and role-based access
- [x] Add admin role checks in controllers

## 3. Payment Processing: Implement Stripe integration
- [x] Add Stripe Java SDK to pom.xml
- [x] Create PaymentService.java
- [x] Create PaymentController.java for checkout and webhooks

## 4. Real-time Features: WebSocket connections for device monitoring
- [x] Add WebSocket starter to pom.xml
- [x] Create WebSocketConfig.java
- [x] Create DeviceMonitoringController.java for real-time updates

## 5. Admin Dashboard: Device and order management
- [x] Create AdminController.java for managing devices and orders
- [x] Update SecurityConfig for admin routes

## 6. Performance: Bundle analysis and optimization
- [x] Add caching dependencies (Redis) to pom.xml
- [x] Configure caching in application properties
- [x] Update docker-compose for Redis service
- [ ] Suggest frontend bundle optimizations

## Followup Steps
- [x] Maven compile successful
- [x] Application starts successfully on port 8080
- [x] Database tables created
- [x] WebSocket broker started
- [x] Security filters configured
- [x] Test API endpoints (auth, payments, admin, WebSocket) - Basic auth endpoints working, JWT signature issue needs fixing, protected endpoints return 403 due to JWT validation failure
- [x] Frontend build successful - Fixed Tailwind config issue, built production assets
- [x] Nginx configuration updated for Spring Boot backend (port 8080) and WebSocket (/ws/)
- [ ] Docker deployment (requires Docker installation)
- [ ] Implement frontend WebSocket client
- [ ] Implement admin UI in frontend
